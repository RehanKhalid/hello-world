Repository for EnergyPlus source code
Hi everyone,

This is Rehan. I am a graduate student at Georgia Tech and currently working on EnergyPlus. My project is regarding energy management of data centers and am currently working on modeling those in EP. I want to add two actuators to EnergyPlus for the object ElectricEquipment:ITE:AirCooled. These are to control the mass flow rate of the air flowing through the server and the temperature of the exit air. Currently, there is only one actuator available for this class, which is used to control the power dissipation of the server.
